This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a baseline implementation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting water temperature (T_degC) using a Linear Regression model. The notebook includes essential steps such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and basic hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: CalCOFI Dataset. It contains various oceanographic measurements, which can be used to predict water temperature.
